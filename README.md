# POM-Employee

POM-Employee is a software project maintained at [andruwsorensen/POM-Employee](https://github.com/andruwsorensen/POM-Employee). This repository is designed to showcase an implementation based on the Page Object Model (POM), a popular design pattern in automated testing. The project focuses on automating employee-related scenarios, such as employee management, adding, updating, and viewing employee data within a sample web application.

## Project Overview

The main goals of the POM-Employee project are:
- Demonstrate the principles of the Page Object Model in UI automation.
- Provide reusable, maintainable, and organized test code for a sample employee management system.
- Streamline automated interactions with web application interfaces related to employees.

## Technologies Used

The project typically includes the following technologies (subject to actual repository contents):

- **Programming Language:**  
  - Most likely Java, Python, or C#, commonly used for test automation.
- **Testing Framework:**  
  - JUnit, TestNG (for Java), or PyTest/Unittest (for Python).
- **Web Automation:**  
  - Selenium WebDriver.
- **Build Tools:**  
  - Maven or Gradle for Java projects.
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  - GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools.
- **Other Libraries:**  
  - Additional assertion or reporting libraries, such as Hamcrest or Allure.

## Structure

The project is typically organized into:
- **Page Object Classes:** Each web page or significant view has its own class describing the elements and actions available.
- **Test Suites:** Collections of tests that automate various user scenarios, interacting with Page Object classes.
- **Utilities:** Helper classes for setup, teardown, and shared functionality.
